# PSVitaRebootShutdown

This is a fork of the original app by Mc_Callum_99. This was made to change the icons for better ones by me (HRudyPlayZ).

This is an app that reboots or powers off your PS Vita. Touch the screen to use! It can also refresh or reset your database to fix your livearea icons.
To compile, run the following from inside the folder with "CMakeLists.txt": 
cmake . && make

This is v1.08 | Better icons EDITION. 
Thanks for using my app! By Mc_Callum_99

Thank you SilicaAndPina (@SilicaDevs) for the help troubleshooting previous versions.
Thank you to SMOKE for making VitaTester open source so I could learn from your code :)
