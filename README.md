# PSVitaRebootShutdown
This is an app that reboots or powers off your PS Vita depending on what trigger you hold. You can now also press X and â–¡ to update the database (keep icons) or left and up on the d-pad to delete the database and restore it (lose icons).

To compile, run the following from inside the folder with "CMakeLists.txt": 
cmake . && make

This is v1.05. 
Thanks for using my app! By Mc_Callum_99

Thank you SilicaAndPina (@VitaDevs) for the help troubleshooting - I'm new to this okay?
